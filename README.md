# Light-switch-that-reacts-on-clapping
The code is for Arduino Uno. It allows to turn ON/OFF the lamp on a specific sound - "clapping". The main purpose was to isolate the specific sound that model will reacts. It shouldn't turn ON/OFF by any other sound except the clapping. 
The model has two modes of sound reaction: 
1. It can turn ON the light on one clap and turn OFF on two claps,
2. It can turn ON/OFF the light on one clap sound.

Modes can be switched by pressing one of used buttons.
The second button allows to turn ON/OFF the lights manually by pressing on it.
